Game Shelf PWA v1.2.79 Release Notes
====================================

Release Date: January 29, 2026

CRITICAL BUG FIXES:
-------------------
* Fixed streak calculation - streaks now actually increment!
  - CRITICAL: Previous code set lastPlayed BEFORE checking if it was yesterday
  - This caused the yesterday check to always fail (comparing today === yesterday)
  - Result: streaks could never grow beyond 1
  - Fix: Save oldLastPlayed before updating, use it for comparison
  
* Fixed timezone mismatch in streak calculation
  - yesterdayStr was using UTC (toISOString) while today uses local time

  - Fixed loadSentNudges() yesterday calculation (was UTC, now local)

  - Fixed calculateStreak() history iteration (was UTC, now local)
  - These bugs could cause incorrect streaks/stats near midnight for users
    in negative UTC offsets (Americas)

NEW FEATURES:
-------------
* Added streak validation on app startup
  - Checks all game streaks when app loads
  - Resets any broken streaks (where lastPlayed is not today or yesterday)
