---

### Q7: clipboard-detection
**Question:** How does clipboard detection work?

**Answer:**
When you return to Game Shelf after playing a puzzle:

1. Game Shelf checks if your clipboard contains a game result
2. If found, it shows a **Tap to Log** card or auto-fills the Record Game sheet
3. Tap to confirm and log

**On Android/Desktop:** This happens automatically in the background.

**On iPhone/iPad:** iOS requires you to tap something first (for privacy), then asks permission to read clipboard.

**Keywords:** clipboard, detection, automatic, detect, how, works, read, paste

---

### Q8: ios-paste-permission
**Question:** Why does iPhone keep asking to allow paste?

**Answer:**
**This is an iOS privacy feature, not a bug.**

Apple requires apps to ask permission every time they read your clipboard. This protects you because clipboards can contain sensitive data (passwords, addresses, etc.).

**What you'll see:**
- A popup asking **"Allow Paste from [Game]?"**
- Tap **Allow** to let Game Shelf read your result

There's no way to "remember" this choice—iOS asks every time. It's one extra tap, but it keeps your data private.

**Keywords:** ios, iphone, ipad, allow, paste, permission, popup, privacy, every time, keeps asking

---

### Q9: record-old-games
**Question:** Can I record games from previous days?

**Answer:**
**No.** Game Shelf records all games for **today's date** only.

If you forgot to log a game yesterday, that result is lost and your streak may have reset.

**Why?** This keeps streaks honest—they reflect actual daily play, not backfilled data.

**Tip:** Enable notifications or set a daily reminder to record your games before midnight!

**Keywords:** old, previous, yesterday, past, backdate, forgot, days ago, history, earlier

---

### Q10: auto-log
**Question:** What is Auto-Log?

**Answer:**
Auto-Log automatically records games when it detects a result on your clipboard—no tapping required.

**To enable/disable:**
Menu → Settings → Game Logging → **Auto-Log Results**

**Note:** Auto-Log only works on **Android and Desktop**. On iPhone/iPad, iOS privacy rules prevent apps from reading the clipboard without your explicit tap.

When Auto-Log fires, you'll see a brief confirmation toast showing what was recorded.

**Keywords:** auto, log, automatic, autolog, setting, toggle, enable, disable

---

## Category 5: Games Tab (8 questions)

### Q1: games-overview
**Question:** What is the Games Tab?

**Answer:**

---

### Q2: how-streaks-work
**Question:** How do streaks work?

**Answer:**
A **streak** counts how many consecutive days you've played a specific game.

**How it works:**
- Day 1: Play Wordle → Streak = 1
- Day 2: Play Wordle → Streak = 2
- Day 3: Miss → Streak resets to 0
- Day 4: Play Wordle → Streak = 1 (starts over)

**Key rules:**
- Each game has its **own separate streak**
- Missing Wordle doesn't affect your Connections streak
- Playing twice in one day doesn't count for the next day
- Your **max streak** (best ever) is always saved

**Keywords:** streak, consecutive, days, row, how, work, count

---

### Q3: current-vs-max-streak
**Question:** What's the difference between Current Streak and Max Streak?

**Answer:**
**Current Streak** = Your active consecutive days right now. Resets to 0 if you miss a day.

**Max Streak** = Your all-time best. Never decreases, even when current streak resets.

**Example:**
- You build a 45-day streak, then miss a day
- Current Streak → 0
- Max Streak → still 45 (your record)
- You start again, reach 30 days
- Current Streak → 30
- Max Streak → still 45

**Keywords:** current, max, best, difference, all-time, record, highest

---

### Q4: streak-reset
**Question:** Why did my streak reset?

**Answer:**
Streaks reset when you **miss a calendar day**. Common causes:

| Cause | What happened |
|-------|---------------|
| **Didn't play** | Simply forgot to play that game |
| **Played but didn't record** | Played but didn't log in Game Shelf |
| **Recorded after midnight** | Logged it but the day had changed |
| **Timezone confusion** | Traveled or device clock was wrong |

**Your max streak is preserved**—only current streak resets.

**Fix:** If your actual game streak is higher, use **Import Stats** to sync it.

**Keywords:** reset, lost, gone, zero, disappeared, why, missing

---

### Q5: streak-time
**Question:** What time do streaks reset?

**Answer:**
**Midnight in your local timezone.**

You have until 11:59 PM to record that day's game. At 12:00 AM, a new day begins.

**Important distinction:**
- **Game reset time** (when new puzzle appears) varies by game—Wordle resets at midnight Eastern
- **Game Shelf streak time** is based on YOUR device's timezone

So if you're in California and play "today's Wordle" at 11 PM PT, it counts for that day in Game Shelf.

**Keywords:** time, midnight, reset, timezone, when, clock, day

---

### Q6: streak-travel
**Question:** How do streaks work when I travel across time zones?

**Answer:**
Game Shelf uses your **device's current timezone**, which changes when you travel.

**What this means:**
- Flying east → Your day gets shorter (less time to play)
- Flying west → Your day gets longer (more time)
- Crossing the date line → Could skip or repeat a calendar day

**Example problem:**
- It's 11 PM Monday in New York, you haven't played
- You fly to London (5 hours ahead)
- You land and it's now 4 AM Tuesday—Monday is gone, streak broken

**Best practice:**
- **Record games before you travel**
- Play early on travel days
- Don't rely on "I'll do it when I land"

**Keywords:** travel, timezone, time zone, flying, trip, vacation, international, abroad

---

### Q7: streak-recovery
**Question:** Can I recover a lost streak?

**Answer:**
**No automatic recovery.** Game Shelf doesn't have streak freezes or undo.

This is intentional—streaks represent actual consecutive play, not backfilled data.

**However, you can use Import Stats** if your Game Shelf streak is wrong:
1. Go to **Stats → By Game → Import Stats**
2. Screenshot your game's actual stats page
3. Game Shelf reads the real streak and updates

This works when:
- You started Game Shelf after building a streak elsewhere
- You played but forgot to record
- A sync issue caused wrong data

**Keywords:** recover, restore, lost, undo, freeze, get back, fix

---

### Q8: view-stats
**Question:** Where can I see my stats?

**Answer:**
Stats appear in multiple places:

| Location | What you see |

---

### Q9: stats-overview
**Question:** What do the stats on the Overview screen mean?

**Answer:**
The **Stats → Overview** shows four summary cards:

| Card | What it means |
|------|---------------|
| **Today** | Number of games you've recorded today |
| **Best Streak** | Your highest *current* streak across all games |
| **Total Played** | Lifetime count of all games recorded |
| **Win Rate** | Overall wins ÷ games played (percentage) |

**Note:** "Best Streak" shows your best *active* streak, not all-time max across all games.

**Keywords:** overview, summary, cards, today, total, win rate, best streak, mean

---

### Q10: stats-by-game
**Question:** How do I see detailed stats for one specific game?

**Answer:**

**Keywords:** track, measure, data, what stats, information, recorded

---

### Q12: stats-mismatch
**Question:** Why are my Game Shelf stats different from the game's own stats?

**Answer:**
Game Shelf only knows about games **you record in the app**. Common mismatches:

| Reason | Example |
|--------|---------|
| **Started GS after playing** | You had a 100-day Wordle streak before installing |
| **Forgot to record** | Played but didn't log it in Game Shelf |
| **Different devices** | Played on work phone, GS is on personal phone |
| **Cleared browser** | Local-only data was lost |

**Fix:** Use **Import Stats** to sync your actual streak from the game's stats screen.

**Keywords:** different, wrong, mismatch, doesn't match, incorrect, sync, off
