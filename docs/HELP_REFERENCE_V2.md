### 2.3 Tap to Log / Clipboard Detection ✅

Game Shelf can automatically detect puzzle results on your clipboard, making recording instant.

**How It Works:**

1. You finish a puzzle (Wordle, Connections, etc.)
2. You tap the game's "Share" button (copies results to clipboard)
3. You return to Game Shelf
4. Game Shelf detects the result and shows "Tap to Log" card
5. You tap to confirm → Recorded!

**Platform Differences:**

| Platform | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| **Android/Desktop** | Silent clipboard detection - "Tap to Log" appears automatically |
| **iOS/iPhone/iPad** | System asks "Allow Paste?" each time (Apple privacy requirement) |

**iOS Permission Prompt:**
When you see "Allow Paste?" on iPhone:
- Tap **Allow** to let Game Shelf read your clipboard
- This is a privacy feature - no app can secretly read your clipboard on iOS
- You'll see this prompt each time (not a bug, it's by design)

**Why "Tap to Log" Might Not Appear:**
- Clipboard is empty (you didn't copy the share text)
- Game isn't supported (check supported games list)
- Share text was modified (extra text added)
- Clipboard contains something else (copied after sharing)
- On iOS: You tapped "Don't Allow" on the permission prompt

**Troubleshooting:**
1. Go back to the game and tap Share again
2. Return to Game Shelf immediately (don't copy anything else)
3. If "Tap to Log" still doesn't appear, use the Record Game button manually
4. As a last resort, long-press Record Game for manual entry

### 2.4 Record Game Button ✅

**Standard Recording Flow (Tap):**

1. Copy your game's share result (from the game's Share button)

| **Games Played** | Total number of games completed |
| **Win Rate** | Percentage of games won |

**Supported Games for Import:**
- ✅ Wordle (NYT)
- ✅ Connections (NYT)
- ✅ Tango (LinkedIn)
- ✅ Queens (LinkedIn)
- ✅ Pinpoint (LinkedIn)
- ✅ Crossclimb (LinkedIn)

**Screenshot Requirements:**
- Must show the game's statistics page
- Should include visible numbers for streak, played, etc.
- Clear, unobstructed view of stats
- Standard orientation (not rotated)

**Import Scenarios:**

| Scenario | What Happens |
|----------|--------------|
| **Stats higher than GS** | Auto-updates your Game Shelf stats |
| **Stats match GS** | Confirms they're in sync |
| **Stats lower than GS** | Asks which to keep (conflict dialog) |
| **Game not tracked** | Offers to add game with imported stats |

**Conflict Handling:**
If your screenshot shows a lower streak than Game Shelf:
- Dialog appears explaining the difference
- Options: Keep Game Shelf stats or Use screenshot stats
- Choose based on which is more accurate

**Troubleshooting:**
- "Couldn't read stats" → Try a clearer screenshot
- "Unknown game" → Game type not recognized
- Wrong numbers → Ensure stats page is fully visible
- Partial import → Some fields may not be detected

### 5.4 Understanding Your Stats ✅

Here's what each statistic means and how it's calculated.

**Games Played**

- **Definition:** Total number of puzzle results you've recorded for that game
- **Counts:** Each day you record a result = +1 to Games Played
- **Scope:** Lifetime total (not resettable)
- **Note:** Recording the same game twice in one day still counts as 1

**Current Streak**

- **Definition:** Consecutive days you've played without missing
- **How It Works:** 
  - Day 1: You play → Streak = 1
  - Day 2: You play → Streak = 2
  - Day 3: You miss → Streak = 0 (resets)
  - Day 4: You play → Streak = 1 (starts over)
- **Timing:** Based on calendar days in your local timezone
- **Important:** If you haven't played today yet, your streak is "at risk"

**Max Streak (Best Streak)**

- **Definition:** Your longest consecutive day streak ever achieved
- **How It Works:**
  - Tracks the highest your Current Streak has ever reached
  - Never decreases (even if current streak resets)
  - Shows your all-time record
- **Example:** If your streak was 45, then reset, then grew to 30 → Max = 45

**Win Rate**

- **Definition:** Percentage of games you won out of games played
- **Calculation:** (Games Won ÷ Games Played) × 100
- **What Counts as a Win:**
  - Wordle: Solved in 6 or fewer guesses
  - Connections: Completed with 4 or fewer mistakes
  - Varies by game type
- **Note:** Some games don't have win/loss (e.g., Spelling Bee score-based)

**Score (Game-Specific)**

Different games track scores differently:

| Game Type | What's Tracked |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Wordle-style** | Guesses (1-6, or X for fail) |
| **Connections** | Mistakes (0-4) |
| **Time-based** | Completion time |
| **Spelling Bee** | Points / Ranking |
| **Mini Crossword** | Time |
| **Strands** | Hints used |

**Stats Across Multiple Games**

- **Total Played:** Sum of all games' played counts
- **Overall Win Rate:** Combined wins ÷ combined played
- **Best Streak:** Highest current streak among all games

**Stats Reset:**
- Individual game stats are preserved even if you remove a game
- Re-adding a game restores your previous stats
- No way to manually reset individual game stats (by design)
- Account deletion removes all stats permanently

**Tips:**
- Check your stats regularly to maintain awareness
- Use Import Stats if Game Shelf shows lower than your actual streak
- Your stats sync across devices when signed in

## Part 6: Streaks

### 6.1 How Streaks Work ✅

Streaks track consecutive days of play for each game.

**What is a Streak?**
- A streak counts how many days in a row you've played a specific game
- Each game has its own independent streak
- Playing today extends your streak; missing a day resets it to zero

**Streak Example:**

| Day | Action | Streak |
|-----|--------|--------|
| Monday | Play Wordle | 1 |
| Tuesday | Play Wordle | 2 |
| Wednesday | Play Wordle | 3 |
| Thursday | **Miss** | **0** (reset) |
| Friday | Play Wordle | 1 (starts over) |

**Key Streak Rules:**

1. **One play per day counts:** Playing twice on Tuesday doesn't count for Wednesday
2. **Calendar day based:** Not 24-hour windows, but actual dates
3. **Each game is separate:** Missing Wordle doesn't affect your Connections streak
4. **Max streak remembered:** Your best streak is saved even after resets

**Where Streaks Appear:**

| Location | What Shows |
|----------|------------|
| **Home screen game cards** | 🔥 badge with current streak |
| **Quick Game buttons** | Streak visible on cards |
| **Stats Overview** | Best streak across all games |
| **Stats By Game** | Each game's current streak |
| **Game detail sheet** | Current + Max streak |

**Maintaining Your Streak:**
- Play each game at least once per calendar day
- Record results in Game Shelf before midnight
- Check Home screen to see which games still need playing
- Use the progress widget to track daily completion

### 6.2 Streak Timing ✅

Understanding when streaks reset is crucial for maintaining them.

**The Basic Rule:**
- Streaks reset at **midnight in your local timezone**
- You have until 11:59 PM to record that day's game
- At 12:00 AM, a new day begins

**Your Timezone vs. Game Timezone:**

Many games reset at different times than midnight:
- **Wordle:** Resets at midnight Eastern Time
- **Connections:** Resets at midnight Eastern Time
- **NYT Mini:** Resets at 10 PM ET (day before)

**But Game Shelf tracks YOUR play:**
- What matters is when YOU record the result
- If you play at 11 PM your time, it counts for that day
- Game Shelf uses your device's timezone

**Common Scenarios:**

| Scenario | Result |
|----------|--------|
| Play Wordle at 11:30 PM Monday | Counts for Monday |
| Record at 12:05 AM Tuesday | Counts for Tuesday |
| Play at 11 PM, record at 12:30 AM | Counts for Tuesday (record time matters) |

**Edge Case: Late Night Play**

If you're playing near midnight:
1. Finish the puzzle
2. Copy the share text immediately
3. Record in Game Shelf **before** midnight
4. If you miss midnight, it counts for the next day

**Travel and Time Zones:**

- Game Shelf uses your device's current timezone
- If you travel: your phone clock adjusts, so does Game Shelf
- International travel may cause apparent streak gaps
- Best practice: Record before traveling across time zones

**"New Puzzle Available" vs "Streak Day":**

| Event | What It Means |
|-------|---------------|
| New puzzle available | Game server released today's puzzle |
| Streak day in GS | Calendar day you recorded a result |

These can be different! A puzzle released at 10 PM ET appears as "today's" puzzle but recording it counts for whatever YOUR calendar day is.

### 6.3 Streak Recovery ✅

What happens when you miss a day, and what your options are.

**When You Miss a Day:**
- Your current streak resets to 0
- Your max streak is preserved (it never decreases)
- Your games played count still includes past plays
- You can start building a new streak immediately

**Can I Recover a Lost Streak?**

**Short answer: No automatic recovery.**

Game Shelf does not have a "streak freeze" or "recovery" feature. This is intentional:
- Streaks represent actual consecutive play
- Recovery would undermine what streaks mean
- Many users requested this design for authenticity

**Alternative: Import Stats**

If your streak in Game Shelf doesn't match your actual game streak:
1. Go to Stats → By Game → Import Stats
2. Screenshot your game's stats page
3. Game Shelf reads your real streak
4. Updates if the imported streak is higher

This is useful when:
- You started using Game Shelf after building a streak
- Game Shelf didn't record a result you actually played
- Data sync issues caused incorrect streak count

**"I Played But Forgot to Record"**

If you played but didn't record:
- Game Shelf can't know about plays it didn't see
- Use Import Stats to sync from the game's own stats
- For games with share text, you might still have it in messages

**Preventing Streak Loss:**

| Tip | Why It Helps |
|-----|--------------|
| Check Home screen daily | Shows which games need recording |
| Record right after playing | Reduces chance of forgetting |
| Enable notifications | Reminders before day ends |
| Set a daily routine | Same time each day |

**Mindset Tip:**
Streaks are meant to be fun motivation, not stress. If you lose one:
- Your max streak shows you've done it before
- You can build it back up
- The games themselves are still enjoyable

**What Happens to Long Streaks:**
- 100+ day streaks → Nothing special (yet)
- No degradation over time
- Streaks continue indefinitely with daily play
- Max streak is your permanent record

### 7.3 Hint Levels Explained ✅

**Level Names and Intensity:**

## Part 12: Economy

### 12.1 Tokens vs Coins ✅

Game Shelf has two currencies with different purposes.

**Tokens (Free Currency)**

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Symbol** | 🪙 or T |
| **Cost** | Free - earned through play |
| **Earning** | Playing games, streaks, battles |
| **Spending** | AI Hints (5), AI Help (5), Token battles |
| **Starting Amount** | 50 tokens for new accounts |

**Coins (Premium Currency)**

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Symbol** | 💰 or C |
| **Cost** | Real money purchase |
| **Earning** | Purchase only |
| **Spending** | Rewards shop, Coin battles |
| **Starting Amount** | 0 (must purchase) |

**Key Differences:**

| Feature | Tokens | Coins |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Free to get? | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| Purchasable? | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
