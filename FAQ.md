## Getting Started

### What is Game Shelf?
Game Shelf is a free app that tracks all your daily puzzle games (Wordle, Connections, etc.) in one place. Instead of losing track of streaks or forgetting scores, Game Shelf keeps everything organized automatically.

### How do I get started?
1. Add games you play to your shelf
2. Play your games normally
3. Copy the share text when you finish
4. Return to Game Shelf and tap "Record Game"

### Is Game Shelf free?
Yes! All core features are free. Optional purchases (coins) unlock premium rewards, but tracking, stats, and basic features are completely free.

### Do I need to create an account?
No, but signing in with Google unlocks additional features: sync across devices, friends, battles, AI hints, and data backup.

## Recording Games

### How do I record a game result?
After completing a puzzle, tap the game's share button to copy results to your clipboard. Return to Game Shelf and tap "Record Game" — it reads your clipboard automatically.

### What if automatic recording doesn't work?
Long-press (hold) the "Record Game" button to open manual entry. Select the game and enter your score manually.

### Can I record multiple games at once?
Yes! If you copy text containing multiple game results, Game Shelf parses them all in one paste.

### What if I record the wrong score?
If you try to record the same game twice, you'll be asked whether to keep the original or replace it.

### Why doesn't Game Shelf recognize my result?
Common reasons:
- Game not supported (check our supported games list)
- Share text modified or has extra text
- Non-standard share format from the game
- Clipboard was empty

### Which games are supported?
34+ games including: Wordle, Connections, Strands, Mini, Spelling Bee, Quordle, Queens, Tango, Worldle, Framed, and more. See Games tab → Browse for the full list.

## Streaks & Stats

### How do streaks work?
A streak counts consecutive days you play a game. Miss a day = streak resets to 0. Each game has its own streak.

### Why did my streak reset?
Streaks reset if you miss a day. Even playing at 11:59 PM counts — it's based on calendar days in your local timezone.

### What time do streaks reset?
Midnight in YOUR local time zone. Note: the games themselves might reset at different times (Wordle resets midnight Eastern), but Game Shelf tracks YOUR play in YOUR timezone.

### Where can I see my stats?
- Stats tab: Overview of all games
- Game card: Shows streak and today's status  
- Long-press any game → Stats: Detailed breakdown

### What stats does Game Shelf track?
Games played, current streak, max streak, win rate, average score, and complete play history.

## AI Hints

### What are AI hints?
Game Shelf can give you hints for certain puzzles using AI. Hints range from subtle nudges to direct answers.

### Which games support hints?
Connections, Wordle, Strands, Spelling Bee, Mini, and Game Shelf originals (Quotle, Rungs, Slate).

### How much do hints cost?
5 tokens per hint. You start with 50 free tokens and earn more through gameplay.

### What are hint levels?
Ten levels from "Whisper" (barely helpful) to "Answer" (full solution). Default is "Nudge" — clear direction without spoiling.

### Why can't I get hints?
You need to: be signed in with Google, have at least 5 tokens, and not have exceeded rate limits (20/hour, 50/day).

## Battles

### What are battles?
Competitive events where 2+ players play the same games over multiple days and compare scores.

### How do I create a battle?
Hub tab → Battles → Create Battle. Choose games, duration, type, and stakes.

### What battle types are there?
- **Total Score**: Highest combined score wins
- **Most Wins**: Each game won = 1 point
- **Perfect Hunter**: Only perfect scores count
- **Streak Challenge**: Daily completion bonuses

### What are stakes?
- **Friendly**: No cost, bragging rights only
- **Coins**: Entry fee in coins, winner takes pool
- **Tokens**: Entry fee in tokens, winner takes pool

### How do I join a battle?
Enter the 6-character code, click an invite link, or browse public battles in the lobby.

### What if I forget to play?
Home screen shows a reminder for unplayed battle games. Missing games hurts your score but doesn't disqualify you.

## Friends & Social

### How do I add friends?
Hub → Friends → Add Friend. Enter their 8-character friend code, share a link, or use the contact finder.

### What's my friend code?
Find it in Hub → Friends. It's your unique 8-character code others use to add you.

### What can friends see?
Your profile, leaderboard rankings, and activity status. They can't see your full history or private stats.

### How do nudges work?
If a friend hasn't played today, tap their profile and "Nudge to Play." They'll see a notification next time they open the app. Limit: one nudge per friend per day.

### How do leaderboards work?
Compare with friends by games played: daily, weekly, or monthly rankings.

## Troubleshooting

### My streak didn't update!
Check that the game was actually recorded (see History). If it's there, the streak should be correct. If you played close to midnight, timezone differences might have affected which day it counted.

### Clipboard paste isn't working (iOS)
iOS asks for permission each time. When you see "Allow Paste?", tap "Allow." If denied, try again or use manual entry.

### The app is running slowly
Try: refresh the page, clear cache (Settings → Developer → Clear Cache), or reinstall the PWA.

### My data disappeared!
If you were signed in, try signing out and back in. If you weren't signed in, local data can be lost when clearing browser data — unfortunately this can't be recovered.

### I don't hear any sounds
Check your device isn't muted. Also check Settings → Sound Effects is enabled. On iOS, you may need to tap the app once before sounds work.

### A game I play isn't supported
Menu → Help & About → Suggest a Game. Include the game name, URL, and sample share text.

---

## Privacy & Data

### What data does Game Shelf collect?
Your puzzle results, stats, and activity. If signed in, your Google profile info (name, email, photo) for identification.

### Is my data private?
Yes. Only you can see your full data. Friends only see what you share (leaderboard rankings, profile).

### Can I export my data?
Menu → Settings & Data → Export Data.

### Can I delete everything?
Yes, Menu → Account → Delete Account removes all data permanently.

---

## Miscellaneous

### What's a PWA?
Progressive Web App. Game Shelf works like a native app when installed to your home screen, but it's actually a website. No app store needed.

### How do I install Game Shelf?
On iOS: Safari → Share → Add to Home Screen.
On Android: Chrome shows an "Install" banner, or Menu → Install.

### Does Game Shelf work offline?
Basic features work offline. Cloud features (sync, hints, battles) require internet.

### How do I contact support?
Menu → Feedback, or email support@gameshelf.co.
